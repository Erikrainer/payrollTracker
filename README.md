## Description

Module 3 Challenge at this time, i have a starter code to modify and create some new features, the CSS and the HTML file was good and working fine, just the JavaScript that needed some new functions to get the employee`s information another one to do a average of the salary and the last one a simple function to choose a random employee, just using evertyhing that we learned in the first 2 days was enough to complete the challenge, it's similar to C++ that i did in the College so was logical stuff trying to remember how to do. For the Acceptance Criteria we have a few conditions, whe the Add Employee button it's clicked it should open a serie of prompts asking for first name, last name, and salary, after adding the employee it should prompt a continue or cancel option, if continue open a new prompt to add the employee if not data is displayed on the sorted alphabetically by last name.
